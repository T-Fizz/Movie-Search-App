# Capital One Software Engineering Summit Coding Challenge
---
My submission for the summer 2021 Capital One Summit for Engineering Challenge.

The solution is written using the React framework. This allows for easy reusability, as well as easily handling the dynamic nature of loading results and displaying them and their information and the user's interactions with them.

#### The challenge is defined as follows:
>[Access the API here.](https://www.omdbapi.com/) To complete this challenge, build a web application that:

> 1) Has a search function specifically for movie titles that results in an intuitive, responsive, mobile friendly, interface. The API allows for searches of tv series and episodes as well, but we would like you to focus your app on ONLY movie title searches

>2) Once a search has been run and a movie title selected, your web app should be able to bring up additional details about the selected title. These details could include, but are not limited to:
>- Release date
>- Runtime
>- Genre
>- Director
>- BONUS - display the movie poster (if available)
>- BONUS - After running a search, allow users to filter within those results based on a time range. (Ex. if a search yielded 100 results, then only show the titles with release dates from 2000-2010)
>- BONUS - In addition to using pagination to show results, include a "show more" button so a user can view more than 10 results at a time. This will be especially useful for the bonus deliverable about filtering by time range

>NOTE - These categories may not be complete for all results, so your app should be able to handle and display empty values

>3) Search results are shown in blocks of 10 titles, so your app should have a pagination feature allowing a user to view multiple pages of results. 

>Submissions will be graded on the following criteria:
>- Meets Deliverables
>- Creativity/Aesthetics (UI/UX)
>- Clarity & Code Quality
